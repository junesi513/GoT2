    "title": "Abstract Representation of Vulnerable Code: Unconditional Type Trustor",
    "concept": "This code assumes that type information passed from an external source is trustworthy and delegates to the internal parser logic based on this assumption. Despite the possibility that 'componentClass' and 'componentType' can differ, it uses them interchangeably in certain sections, performing instantiation without validation.",
    "core_flaw": "The core flaw is that critical information determining the system's behavior (the type) is introduced from external input but is used without any structural validation or reliability checks. Specifically, if the type information used in the type inference process and the parsing delegation process mismatches, malicious objects can be created through a vulnerable path.",
    "analogy": "This is like passing a blueprint received from an external source to the production line without review. Even though problems in the blueprint could lead to the creation of dangerous machinery or parts, a structure that passes it on based solely on its appearance is highly vulnerable from a security perspective.",
    "quote": "Under the assumption that 'all input can be potentially hostile,' the reliability of input data must be verified before it is used for system control decisions. (Source: Secure Coding Principles)"
