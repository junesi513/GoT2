Root Cause Analysis Report
Component: ObjectArrayCodec.java
Vulnerability ID: CWE-20 – Improper Input Validation
Context: Deserialization of JSON arrays to Java object arrays

Overview
This report analyzes the vulnerability present in the method:

```java
public <T> T deserialze(DefaultJSONParser parser, Type type, Object fieldName)
in the ObjectArrayCodec class of Fastjson. The core issue lies in the improper validation of types during deserialization, enabling potential unsafe type resolution and object creation based on attacker-controlled input.
```

Vulnerability Summary
Field	Description
CWE ID	CWE-20
Title	Improper Input Validation
Root Cause	Failure to restrict componentClass derivation and unchecked deserialization
Attack Vector	JSON input with unexpected or malicious structure
Impact	Potential gadget deserialization → RCE
Vulnerable Code	parser.parseArray(componentClass, array, fieldName);

Root Cause Details
Vulnerable Behavior
In the following vulnerable statement:

```java
parser.parseArray(componentClass, array, fieldName);
The componentClass is derived dynamically from user-supplied type information:
```

```java
componentClass = TypeUtils.getClass(componentType);
No input validation or type restrictions are applied before this class is used to instantiate array elements.

The parser proceeds to deserialize attacker-controlled data using this potentially unsafe class type.
```

Dangerous Consequences
If componentClass resolves to a sensitive or dangerous class (e.g., from JDK, 3rd-party libraries with side-effects), an attacker can inject a crafted JSON array that leads to:

Instantiation of unwanted classes.

Triggering of deserialization gadgets.

Remote Code Execution (RCE) if gadget chains exist.

Why This is CWE-20
CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is defined as:
"The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program."

In this case:

The product accepts JSON input that ultimately controls how Java objects are created.

There is no validation of the target component class, allowing unsafe or malicious input to control control/data flow.

The method lacks any security check, allowlist, or safeguard prior to parsing attacker-controlled JSON arrays into Java arrays.

Human Patch (Intended Fix)
While the patched code looks identical in this snippet, the actual defense in Fastjson's real fix is implemented outside this class — typically via:

```java
ParserConfig.getGlobalInstance().setAutoTypeSupport(false);
ParserConfig.getGlobalInstance().addAccept("com.myapp.models.");
This enforces allowlisting of safe types and disables auto type resolution — both critical protections missing in the vulnerable context.
```

Recommendations
Mitigation (code-level)
Introduce allowlisting of componentClass before calling parseArray.

Reject any dynamic or reflective resolution that points to system or untrusted types.

System-wide Safeguard
In ParserConfig, enforce:

```java
ParserConfig.getGlobalInstance().setAutoTypeSupport(false);
or whitelist specific packages:
```
```java
ParserConfig.getGlobalInstance().addAccept("com.safe.package.");
```Conclusion
The vulnerable code in ObjectArrayCodec fails to validate the class used for deserializing array elements, enabling unsafe type casting and recursive deserialization through user-supplied input. This classic case of CWE-20 can lead to serious consequences, including deserialization attacks and RCE if proper type constraints and parsing protections are not applied.
