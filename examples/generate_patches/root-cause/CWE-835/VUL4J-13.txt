Root Cause Analysis of CWE-835 in RgbeInfo
The vulnerability (CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition) in the RgbeInfo class, as indicated by the provided code changes, is located within the decompress method. The root cause of this vulnerability is the failure to explicitly handle an unexpected end-of-stream (EOF) condition when decompressing RGBE image data, which could lead to an infinite loop.

Understanding CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition
CWE-835 describes a software defect where a loop's termination condition can never be met under certain circumstances, causing the program to execute the loop indefinitely. This typically leads to a denial of service, as the program consumes excessive CPU cycles and memory without making progress, effectively hanging or crashing. Such vulnerabilities often arise from:

Incorrect loop conditions.

Modification of loop control variables in an unexpected way.

External factors (like input data) preventing the condition from being satisfied.

The Core Problem: Unhandled EOF in Decompression Loop
The decompress method is responsible for decompressing a scanline of RGBE pixel data from an InputStream into a byte array (out). It uses a while (position < total) loop to ensure all expected bytes are processed. Inside this loop, it reads a byte n from the input stream, which acts as a run-length encoding (RLE) indicator.

The flaw in the original code arises when the input stream unexpectedly reaches its end (EOF) before all the total bytes for the output array have been filled.

Specific Vulnerabilities Arising from the Loop's Logic:
Misinterpretation of InputStream.read() for EOF:

The in.read() method returns -1 when the end of the stream is reached.

In the original code, if in.read() returned -1 for the n variable (the RLE indicator), n would become -1.

The subsequent if (n > 128) condition would evaluate to false (since -1 is not greater than 128).

Control would then pass to the else block: for (int i = 0; i < n; i++). This loop would effectively become for (int i = 0; i < -1; i++).

Creation of an Unreachable Exit Condition:

A for loop with a condition like i < -1 will never execute its body.

Crucially, if the for loop in the else block does not execute, the position variable (which tracks the progress of filling the out array) will not be incremented.

Since position remains unchanged, and position is still less than total (because an unexpected EOF occurred prematurely), the while (position < total) loop condition will remain true indefinitely.

This leads to an infinite loop where the decompress method repeatedly attempts to read from an already exhausted stream, gets -1 for n, and then does nothing, never advancing position.

Denial of Service:

An attacker could craft a malformed RGBE image file that is truncated or ends abruptly.

When the JpegDecoder attempts to decompress such a file, the decompress method would enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources and preventing the application from processing further requests or completing its task. This results in a denial of service.

The patch directly addresses this by adding an explicit check if (n < 0) immediately after reading the byte n. If n is -1 (EOF), it throws an ImageReadException("Error decompressing RGBE file"). This ensures that the loop terminates with an appropriate error when the input stream is exhausted prematurely, preventing the infinite loop and mitigating the denial of service vulnerability.
